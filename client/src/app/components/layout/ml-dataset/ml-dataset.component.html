        We currently have <span class="bold">{{numPlacements}}</span> placements from  <span class="bold">{{numGames}}</span>
        games stored in our tetrisfish database. To train a ML board evaluation model, we filter
        to only placements on level 18, on games where the player completed at least most level 18.
        To get started, press the button below to extract this data from our database.

        Our ML model is a simple one. Given a surface array, which is a 10-element array of the
        height at each column, evaluate the board as a single number. We use an existing AI, StackRabbit,
        to generate a "ground truth" evaluation for each placement. We then train a simple regression
        model to predict the ground truth evaluation from the surface array. However, since we're simplifying
        the problem to only consider the surface array, we want to ignore boards that have holes in them, as they
        would not be adequately represented by the surface array.

        Press the button below to filter out placements with holes.

        Now, we must calculate the surface array for each placement, and make an API request to the StackRabbit
        AI in order to obtain the ground truth board evaluation. This will take a bit. Once it's done, it'll
        be exported as labelled_placements.csv!
